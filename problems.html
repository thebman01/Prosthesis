            <p><ol><li>The biggest issue with today's prosthetics is the high cost as they are very expensive and many in need are unable to afford it
              <li> It is well known that today's prosthetics tend to cause skin irritations and rashes. They may also require additional surgeries which furthermore add to the cost.
                <li>Another issue with the today's world of prosthetics is the time necessary to both adjust to the prosthetics and getting them on and off for specific times.(such as sleeping when you don't want your prosthetic to get stuck on a blanket or sheet.
                  <li>The current solution to solve some issues regarding the time necessary is only making matters worse. Inventors are installing apps inside the prosthetics to improve grip and stability for the users prosthetics. These apps sound very helpful for the user's limbs; however, these apps can be hacked and if the programming for these apps end up in the wrong hands, users could lose all control of their prosthetic. 
                    <li> One of the less discussed issues is that the current prosthetics on the market tend to slip, loosen or just fall off. A prime example of this concern comes from Heather Mills (former spouse of Paul McCartney). She was participating on the TV show, "Dancing on Ice" when her prosthetic leg flew off mid-routine. </p>
