                <em><center> <br><br>The world changing is a scary thing, but in this case it's a great change!</center>



 <br> <p> <br>We have created a new kind of prosthetics; but these aren't just any prosthetics, these prosthetics directly connect to the peripheral nerrvous system which connects the brain to the spinal cord, to the rest of the body. So, by connecting these prosthetics to the peripheral nervous system, whatever your brain thinks (in regard to movement of the limb) is how the limb will move.
 For example, if you have one of our innovate prosthetic limbs, lets say a leg for instance and you want to walk forward. All of you have to do is somewhere in your brain have a thought about walking; so, if you want to walk forward, you'll walk forward with no issue.</em>
