            <p>In the US, more than 1.6 <strong> MILLION</strong> people have some type of limb loss and over 185,000 Americans annually have amputations performed. All kinds of people require amputations and prosthetics. <ol> <li>Bethany Hamilton (AKA: The soul surfer) had her life turned upside-down when a shark bit of one of her arms. She is now well know as one of the most successful amputees of all time. However, there are still many things she cam not do and providing new prosthetics can help her perform her daily activites and improve her surfing (balance0
                <li> Ella Fitzgerald (AKA: The Queen of Jazz) and 13 time Grammy Award winner had both of her legs amputated due to the effects of diabetes. This ended her music career far too soon and our prosthetics could've helped her get back on her feet (literally and figurativlely)
                    <li> One of the main reasons for these new prosthetics are the many tragic injuries that soldiers sustain. In Iraq, in 2012 alone, there were over 1500 amputees;including many who will never be the same. These soldiers fight for our country year long and they deserve proper care; they should be provided the proper prosthetics and as a benefit the cost should be reduced to little or none.
                        <li>Believe it or not, millions of children are born either with missing limbs or with limbs in the wrong places. This is just one more reason that our prosthetics are needed; to provide these newborns the chance for something even remotely close to a normal life. </p>
