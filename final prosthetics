    <br><br><br><br><br>    <font size="10"    <p><u>Problems With Current Prosthetic Limbs</p></u>
            <p><ol><li>The biggest issue with today's prosthetics is the high cost as they are very expensive and many in need are unable to afford it
              <li> It is well known that today's prosthetics tend to cause skin irritations and rashes. They may also require additional surgeries which firthermore add to the cost.
                <li>Another issue with the today's world of prosthetics is the time necessary to both adjust to the prosthetics and getting them on and off for specific times.(such as sleeping when you don't want your prosthetic to get stuck on a blanket or sheet.
                  <li>The current solution to solve some issues regarding the time necessary is only making matters worse. They are cheaply creating apps in the arm to improve grip and stability. However, these apps can be hacked more simply than our prosthetic which could lead to the entire arm being hacked. 
                    <li> One of the less discussed issues is that the current prosthetics on the market tend to slip, loosen or just fall off. A prime example of this concern comes from Heather Mills (former spouse of Paul McCartney). She was participating on the TV show, "Dancing on Ice" when her prosthetic leg flew off mid-routine. </p>

            <p>Why Our Prosthetics are Needed</p>
            <p>In the US, more than 1.6 <strong> MILLION</strong> people have some type of limb loss and over 185,000 Americans annually have amputations performed. All kinds of people require amputations and prosthetics. <ol> <li>Bethany Hamilton (AKA: The soul surfer) had her life turned upside-down when a shark bit of one of her arms. She is now well know as one of the most successful amputees of all time. However, there are still many things she cam not do and providing new prosthetics can help her perform her daily activites and improve her surfing (balance0
                <li> Ella Fitzgerald (AKA: The Queen of Jazz) and 13 time Grammy Award winner had both of her legs amputated due to the effects of diabetes. This ended her music career far too soon and our prosthetics could've helped her get back on her feet (literally and figurativlely)
                    <li> One of the main reasons for these new prosthetics are the many tragic injuries that soldiers sustain. In Iraq, in 2012 alone, there were over 1500 amputees;including many who will never be the same. These soldiers fight for our country year long and they deserve proper care; they should be provided the proper prosthetics and as a benefit the cost should be reduced to little or none.
                        <li>Believe it or not, millions of children are born either with missing limbs or with limbs in the wrong places. This is just one more reason that our prosthetics are needed; to provide these newborns the chance for something even remotely close to a normal life. </p>

<br>We have created a new kind of prosthetics; but these aren't just any prosthetics, these prosthetics directly connect to the peripheral nerrvous system which connects the brain to the spinal cord, to the rest of the body. So, by connecting these prosthetics to the peripheral nervous system, whatever your brain thinks (in regard to movement of the limb) is how the limb will move.
<em> For example, if you have one of our innovate prosthetic limbs, lets say a leg for instance and you want to walk forward. All of you have to do is somewhere in your brain have a thought about walking; so, if you want to walk forward, you'll walk forward with no issue.</em>

     <h2>Who we are</h2>
     <body>We are a small group of coders with big dreams. We want to change the world by solving an issue that is rarely thought of; the mobility of prosthetic limbs.While this is only a concept, we hope it will become much more than hat, and make an impact on people's lives.-<em>Bryce,Matt,Anjali,Leian</em></body>
